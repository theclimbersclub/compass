## Vision

> To connect, organise & enhance your club, it's people & it's management experience.

## About

Compass came from years of listening and observing duplicated effort and costs bourne by individual clubs, all stretching for the same goals.

> guiding your club management to compliance

Most clubs rely on volunteers and goodwill. Processes and system have typically evolved, mostly over the last decade. Today's data custodians need to be far more alert to the clear and present danger of data loss and mis-management.

With changes to the law, the responsibility of personal data management and a tide of threats to user based devices. The risk is present, real and automated. Obscurity or only a handful of members isn't a valid defence.

So with legal and morale challenges, around best endeavours, security, hosting, data storage and use. It's only a matter of time till the worst happens, you loose or cannot access your club data.

Compass then, intends to offer a robust, secure & useable system that can tackle most of your clubs daily needs. We fully acknowledge some tasks still require a
touch of the human spirit to resolve.

Compass is built from the ground up to be secure and robust, with flexible modules.
